# Gain Robust Tracker

This is a Joint Radiometric Calibration and Feature Tracking System. For the algorithm introduction, see [post in my blog](https://sxij.xyz/posts/joint_radiometric_calibration_and_feature_tracking_system/).

There are still some problems in my implementation process, mainly because the calibrated radiometric parameters are not realistic.
